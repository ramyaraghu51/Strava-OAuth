# Strava!

This project includes a Node.js server script and a web page that connects to it. The front-end page presents two options to Login with Strava and Login with Fitbit, sending the authorization code to the back-end API running on the server. The server requests the "https://www.strava.com/oauth/token" üé® and receives the access token,refresh token pair.With the access token received from the JSON response,the server requests "https://www.strava.com/api/v3/athlete/activities" to get the activities of the user.

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) is a popular runtime that lets you run server-side JavaScript. This project uses the [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/) framework and explores basic templating with [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/).

‚Üê `README.md`: That‚Äôs this file, where you can tell people what your cool website does and how you built it.

‚Üê `public/style.css`: The styling rules for the pages in your site.

‚Üê `server.js`: The **Node.js** server script for your new site. The JavaScript defines the endpoints in the site back-end, one to return the homepage index .hbs and another file callback.hbs. Each one sends data to a Handlebars template which builds these parameter values into the web page the visitor sees.

‚Üê `package.json`: The NPM packages for the project's dependencies.

‚Üê `src/`: This folder holds the site template along with some basic data files.


‚Üê 'bundle.js': This page contains the source code for calendar implementation. Futher this page parses the JSON response and displays it in a calendar.
‚Üê 'src/pages/index.hbs':  This is the main page template for your site. The template receives parameters from the server script, which it includes in the page HTML.The page sends the authorization code as a query parameter to the callback.hbs page.

How to further develop the project?
Our application is functional only when the user is logged in. Currently there is not a database setup to store the User_id, access_token,refresh_token pair. In the server.js file, we can define a backend url and post the user_id,access_token and refresh token pair so that it gets stored in the database. With such a set up in place, we will be able to make our backend url request the strava application once a day and store the user's activites in the database. This way, even when the users are not logged in , we can still trigger this function ans store the activties. Then it will be possible to generate a report that has the user_id and a boolean value that says whether they  have done ore than 7000 steps.
