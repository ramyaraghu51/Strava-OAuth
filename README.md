# Strava!

This project includes a Node.js server script and a web page that connects to it. The front-end page presents two options to Login with Strava and Login with Fitbit, sending the authorization code to the back-end API running on the server. The server requests the "https://www.strava.com/oauth/token" üé® and receives the access token,refresh token pair.With the access token received from the JSON response,the server requests "https://www.strava.com/api/v3/athlete/activities" to get the activities of the user.

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) is a popular runtime that lets you run server-side JavaScript. This project uses the [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/) framework and explores basic templating with [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/).
